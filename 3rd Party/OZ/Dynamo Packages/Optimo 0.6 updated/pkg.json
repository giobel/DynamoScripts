{"license":"MIT","file_hash":null,"name":"Optimo","version":"0.0.6","description":"Optimo is a multi-objective optimization tool that enables Dynamo users to optimize problems with single and multiple objectives using evolutionary algorithms. Optimo includes various multi-objective optimization algorithm to reach to a set of optimal solutions (in the current version NSGA-II  (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II) is included, More algorithms including SMPSO and MOEAD will be added soon). Optimo is developed by Mohammad Rahmani Asl and Dr. Wei Yan in the BIM-SIM (http://bim-sim.org/) Lab at Texas A&M University using jmetal.NET (http://jmetalnet.sourceforge.net/) open source code. Optimo source code is available on Optimo Github (https://github.com/mrahmaniasl/Optimo). Please see the Github Wiki page to learn more about Optimo and its updates.","group":"Optimo","keywords":["evolutionary","multi-objective","optimization","genetic","algorithm","nsga-ii","optimo"],"dependencies":[],"contents":"Loop Completion Check - A function that checcks if the loop is completed, NSGA_II Function-Point on Surface - The function that does the generation for NSGA_II., NSGA_II Function-SCH - The function that does the generation for NSGA_II.","engine_version":"0.7.4.3192","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"","repository_url":"","contains_binaries":true,"node_libraries":["Optimo, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"]}
